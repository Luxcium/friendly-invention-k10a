# Python Directory

This folder contains the Python virtual environment (`.venv`) and will be used for any additional Python scripts, modules, or requirements files needed for notebook and Python development in this project.

- The `.venv` subfolder is auto-generated and should not be committed to version control.
- Place any project-specific Python scripts or requirements files here.

## Structure

- `python/` (this folder)
  - `.venv/` (virtual environment)
- `notebooks/` (sibling folder, one level up)
  - Contains Jupyter notebooks for the project

## Memory Bank Integration

- The existence and structure of the `python/` directory, as well as its relationship to the `notebooks/` folder, should be documented in the Memory Bank for project continuity.
- Update the Memory Bank if new scripts or requirements are added here.
