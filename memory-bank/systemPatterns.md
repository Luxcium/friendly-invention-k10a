# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview

### System Architecture
[High-level system design and component relationships]

### Core Design Principles
- [Principle 1 - rationale and application]
- [Principle 2 - rationale and application]
- [Principle 3 - rationale and application]

### Architectural Style
[Monolithic | Microservices | Serverless | Event-Driven | etc.]

## Key Technical Decisions

### Language and Framework Choices
- **Primary Language**: [Language - justification]
- **Framework**: [Framework - rationale]
- **Runtime Environment**: [Environment - requirements]

### Data Architecture
- **Data Storage**: [Database/storage solution - rationale]
- **Data Flow**: [How data moves through the system]
- **State Management**: [How state is handled and persisted]

### Infrastructure Decisions
- **Deployment Model**: [Local | Cloud | Hybrid - rationale]
- **Scalability Strategy**: [Horizontal | Vertical | Auto-scaling approach]
- **Monitoring and Observability**: [Tools and approaches]

## Design Patterns in Use

### Structural Patterns
- [Pattern 1 - where used and why]
- [Pattern 2 - where used and why]
- [Pattern 3 - where used and why]

### Behavioral Patterns
- [Pattern 1 - implementation approach]
- [Pattern 2 - implementation approach]
- [Pattern 3 - implementation approach]

### Integration Patterns
- [API design patterns]
- [Communication patterns]
- [Error handling patterns]

## Component Relationships

### Core Components
```
[Component Diagram or Description]
- Component A: [Purpose and responsibilities]
- Component B: [Purpose and responsibilities]
- Component C: [Purpose and responsibilities]
```

### Dependencies
- [Internal dependencies - why they exist]
- [External dependencies - risk mitigation]
- [Circular dependencies - resolution strategy]

### Interface Contracts
- [API contracts and expectations]
- [Data contracts between components]
- [Event contracts for messaging]

## Critical Implementation Paths

### Core User Flows
1. [Primary user flow - technical implementation]
2. [Secondary user flow - technical implementation]
3. [Error/edge case flow - handling approach]

### Critical System Operations
- [Startup/initialization sequence]
- [Shutdown/cleanup procedures]
- [Health check and monitoring endpoints]

### Performance Critical Paths
- [High-traffic operations - optimization strategy]
- [Resource-intensive operations - efficiency measures]
- [Real-time operations - latency requirements]

## Quality Attributes

### Performance Requirements
- [Response time expectations]
- [Throughput requirements]
- [Resource utilization limits]

### Reliability Patterns
- [Error handling strategy]
- [Retry mechanisms]
- [Circuit breaker patterns]
- [Graceful degradation]

### Security Patterns
- [Authentication approach]
- [Authorization model]
- [Data protection measures]
- [Secure communication protocols]

## Evolution Strategy

### Extensibility Points
- [Where the system can be extended]
- [Plugin or module architecture]
- [Configuration-driven behavior]

### Technical Debt Management
- [Known technical debt items]
- [Refactoring priorities]
- [Modernization roadmap]

### Migration Strategies
- [Data migration approaches]
- [System migration patterns]
- [Backward compatibility maintenance]

## AI Agent Instructions

### Pattern Compliance
- **MANDATORY**: All code changes must align with established patterns
- **MANDATORY**: Deviations require explicit justification and documentation
- **MANDATORY**: New patterns must be documented here immediately

### Architecture Enforcement
- **MANDATORY**: Verify component relationships before modifications
- **MANDATORY**: Ensure interface contracts are maintained
- **MANDATORY**: Performance implications must be considered

### Cross-Agent Coordination
- This file defines the technical foundation all AI agents must respect
- Architecture changes require consensus and full documentation
- Pattern violations indicate need for system redesign consideration
