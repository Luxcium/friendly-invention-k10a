# Creating Custom Chat Modes

You will create a new chat mode:

1. Create a `.chatmode.md` file in `memory-bank/chatmodes/`
2. Add a front matter header with `description`, `tools`, and `model` fields
3. Write clear, concise instructions in the body, focused on the chat mode's purpose
4. Reference any relevant instructions files using relative Markdown links
5. Do not duplicate tool listsâ€”rely on user or workspace configuration
6. Use only one top-level header per file

[Follow the instruction in chatmode creation instructions](../instructions/chatmode-creation.instructions.md)
