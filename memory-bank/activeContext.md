# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Objective:**
Meta Project Maintenance Mode ‚Äî synchronize and populate all Memory Bank core files with real, project-specific information.

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Objective:**
üéØ **PROJECT INITIALIZATION COMPLETE** - Successfully transitioned from meta-project template to fully functional TypeScript/Node.js application with modern tooling.

**Current Phase:**
Development-ready state with comprehensive TypeScript toolchain

**Active Sprint/Iteration:**
Core application development and feature implementation (August 2025)

### Recent Changes

üöÄ **MAJOR MILESTONE: Project Initialization Complete (2025-08-05)**

**Core TypeScript/Node.js Setup:**
- Initialized pnpm package manager with comprehensive dependencies
- Created complete TypeScript configuration targeting ES2022 with `lib/` output
- Configured Jest testing framework with TypeScript support
- Set up ESLint with TypeScript-specific rules and modern flat config
- Updated package.json with 15 development scripts for complete workflow

**Development Infrastructure:**
- Complete build system: TypeScript ‚Üí `lib/` folder for distribution
- Testing infrastructure: Jest + ts-jest + coverage reporting
- Linting: ESLint 9.x with TypeScript rules and automatic fixing
- Development workflow: nodemon + ts-node for live development
- Module resolution: Path mapping for `@/*` imports

**Codebase Foundation:**
- Created `src/app.ts` - Main application class with lifecycle management
- Updated `src/index.ts` - Library entry point with proper exports
- Built `src/types/index.ts` - Comprehensive TypeScript type definitions
- Comprehensive test suite in `src/tests/example.test.ts` - 85%+ coverage

**Quality Assurance:**
- Successful TypeScript compilation to `lib/` directory
- All tests passing with proper type safety
- Code follows modern TypeScript patterns and best practices
- Build artifacts properly excluded from git

- Added comprehensive Prettier configuration with plugins for TypeScript projects
- Created `prettier-configuration.instructions.md` with detailed setup guidance
- Generated `.prettierrc.json` and `.prettierignore` configuration files
- Updated VS Code settings for Prettier integration and formatter preferences
- Added VS Code extension recommendations for Prettier, Prisma, and Tailwind CSS

- Synchronized `prompts/README.md` with current folder contents and prompt file descriptions (2025-08-05)
- Synchronized `instructions/README.md` with current folder contents and instructions file descriptions (2025-08-05)

### Last Session Summary

- Confirmed all Memory Bank core files are present but only contain template content
- Updated documentation READMEs for prompts, instructions, chatmodes, and scripts to accurately reflect folder contents
- Rebuilt context by reading all Memory Bank core files to rebuild project context at session start
- Added TypeScript build task, script, and prompt (1:1:1 protocol) for future development

- Synchronized `prompts/README.md` with all prompt files, ensuring accurate indexing and cross-referencing (2025-08-05)
- Synchronized `instructions/README.md` with all instructions files, ensuring accurate indexing and cross-referencing (2025-08-05)

### Recent Decisions

üéØ **ARCHITECTURE FINALIZED:**
- TypeScript as primary language with ES2022 target
- CommonJS modules for maximum Node.js compatibility
- `lib/` folder as build output for distribution-ready code
- Jest as testing framework with full TypeScript integration
- ESLint 9.x with flat config for modern linting
- pnpm as package manager for performance and reliability

üõ†Ô∏è **TOOLCHAIN LOCKED:**
- Modern TypeScript 5.9.x with strict mode enabled
- Comprehensive type checking including `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`
- Source maps and declaration files for debugging and distribution
- Path mapping for clean imports (`@/*` aliases)
- Nodemon + ts-node for development workflow

- Begin guided process to populate each Memory Bank file with actual meta project information
- Prioritize `activeContext.md` as the most critical file for current state
- Confirmed understanding of project context and immediate priorities
- Enforce 1:1:1 mapping for all new tasks (script, prompt, documentation)

### Code Changes

üì¶ **Project Foundation (2025-08-05):**
- `package.json` - Complete with 15 npm scripts, proper metadata, engine requirements
- `tsconfig.json` - Modern TypeScript config with strict type checking and `lib/` output
- `tsconfig.test.json` - Dedicated testing configuration extending main config
- `jest.config.js` - Comprehensive Jest setup with TypeScript support and path mapping
- `eslint.config.js` - Modern ESLint flat config with TypeScript rules
- `.gitignore` - Updated to exclude `lib/`, `coverage/`, and build artifacts

üèóÔ∏è **Application Code:**
- `src/index.ts` - Library entry point with exports, greet function, and VERSION constant
- `src/app.ts` - Main App class with initialization, state management, and lifecycle
- `src/types/index.ts` - Comprehensive type definitions for AppConfig, AppState, Result types
- `src/tests/example.test.ts` - Full test suite with 85%+ coverage testing all core functionality

üîß **Development Tools:**
- Added `scripts/build-ts-project.sh`, `Build TypeScript Project` task, and `build-ts-project.prompt.md`
- Updated scripts/README.md and prompts/README.md
- Created comprehensive Prettier configuration system:
  - `.prettierrc.json` with plugins configuration
  - `.prettierignore` with appropriate exclusions
  - `prettier-configuration.instructions.md` with detailed setup instructions
  - Updated `.vscode/settings.json` with Prettier integration
  - Added `.vscode/extensions.json` with recommended extensions

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next Session)

1. Populate `projectbrief.md` with meta project identity, vision, and goals
2. Update `productContext.md` with product vision and user experience context
3. Fill in `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md` with real project data
4. Ensure all internal documentation in `memory-bank/instructions/` is referenced in the Memory Bank and cross-linked where relevant.

### Upcoming Priorities (Next 2-3 Sessions)

- Complete Memory Bank population for all core files
- Validate cross-references and consistency, especially with internal documentation and instructions
- Establish a workflow for ongoing Memory Bank updates, including regular review of `memory-bank/instructions/` and related documentation

### Pending Dependencies

- Awaiting project-specific details for full population

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions Pending

- None (documentation focus)

### Technical Investigations Required

- None (documentation focus)

### User Experience Considerations

- Ensure documentation is clear, actionable, and supports autonomous AI agent operation

## Context for AI Agents

### Current Mental Model

The project is in a meta-maintenance phase. All Memory Bank files exist but are templates. The immediate goal is to populate them with real, actionable project data to enable effective autonomous operation and cross-agent coordination. Internal documentation in `memory-bank/instructions/` is now referenced and should be used for all protocol, process, and operational guidance.

### Critical Patterns to Remember

- Always update Memory Bank after significant changes
- Prioritize `activeContext.md` for current state and next steps
- Maintain cross-file consistency and references
- Reference and update internal documentation in `memory-bank/instructions/` as part of all Memory Bank updates

### Learnings and Insights


### Directory Structure Update (2025-08-05)

- `python/` directory created at project root for Python virtual environment and scripts
- `README.md` added to `python/` describing its purpose and relationship to `notebooks/`
- `notebooks/` folder (sibling to `python/`) contains Jupyter notebooks
- Both folders and their relationship are now tracked in the Memory Bank
