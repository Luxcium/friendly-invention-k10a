# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Objective:**
Meta Project Maintenance Mode — synchronize and populate all Memory Bank core files with real, project-specific information.

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Objective:**
Meta Project Maintenance Mode — synchronize and populate all Memory Bank core files with real, project-specific information. Ensure all internal documentation (see `memory-bank/instructions/`) is referenced and integrated into the Memory Bank for discoverability and operational clarity.

**Current Phase:**
Meta-maintenance and documentation synchronization

**Active Sprint/Iteration:**
Memory Bank population and validation (August 2025)

### Recent Changes

- Added comprehensive Prettier configuration with plugins for TypeScript projects
- Created `prettier-configuration.instructions.md` with detailed setup guidance
- Generated `.prettierrc.json` and `.prettierignore` configuration files
- Updated VS Code settings for Prettier integration and formatter preferences
- Added VS Code extension recommendations for Prettier, Prisma, and Tailwind CSS

- Synchronized `prompts/README.md` with current folder contents and prompt file descriptions (2025-08-05)
- Synchronized `instructions/README.md` with current folder contents and instructions file descriptions (2025-08-05)

### Last Session Summary

- Confirmed all Memory Bank core files are present but only contain template content
- Updated documentation READMEs for prompts, instructions, chatmodes, and scripts to accurately reflect folder contents
- Rebuilt context by reading all Memory Bank core files to rebuild project context at session start
- Added TypeScript build task, script, and prompt (1:1:1 protocol) for future development

- Synchronized `prompts/README.md` with all prompt files, ensuring accurate indexing and cross-referencing (2025-08-05)
- Synchronized `instructions/README.md` with all instructions files, ensuring accurate indexing and cross-referencing (2025-08-05)

### Recent Decisions

- Begin guided process to populate each Memory Bank file with actual meta project information
- Prioritize `activeContext.md` as the most critical file for current state
- Confirmed understanding of project context and immediate priorities
- Enforce 1:1:1 mapping for all new tasks (script, prompt, documentation)

### Code Changes

- Added `scripts/build-ts-project.sh`, `Build TypeScript Project` task, and `build-ts-project.prompt.md`
- Updated scripts/README.md and prompts/README.md
- Created comprehensive Prettier configuration system:
  - `.prettierrc.json` with plugins configuration
  - `.prettierignore` with appropriate exclusions
  - `prettier-configuration.instructions.md` with detailed setup instructions
  - Updated `.vscode/settings.json` with Prettier integration
  - Added `.vscode/extensions.json` with recommended extensions

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next Session)

1. Populate `projectbrief.md` with meta project identity, vision, and goals
2. Update `productContext.md` with product vision and user experience context
3. Fill in `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md` with real project data
4. Ensure all internal documentation in `memory-bank/instructions/` is referenced in the Memory Bank and cross-linked where relevant.

### Upcoming Priorities (Next 2-3 Sessions)

- Complete Memory Bank population for all core files
- Validate cross-references and consistency, especially with internal documentation and instructions
- Establish a workflow for ongoing Memory Bank updates, including regular review of `memory-bank/instructions/` and related documentation

### Pending Dependencies

- Awaiting project-specific details for full population

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions Pending

- None (documentation focus)

### Technical Investigations Required

- None (documentation focus)

### User Experience Considerations

- Ensure documentation is clear, actionable, and supports autonomous AI agent operation

## Context for AI Agents

### Current Mental Model

The project is in a meta-maintenance phase. All Memory Bank files exist but are templates. The immediate goal is to populate them with real, actionable project data to enable effective autonomous operation and cross-agent coordination. Internal documentation in `memory-bank/instructions/` is now referenced and should be used for all protocol, process, and operational guidance.

### Critical Patterns to Remember

- Always update Memory Bank after significant changes
- Prioritize `activeContext.md` for current state and next steps
- Maintain cross-file consistency and references
- Reference and update internal documentation in `memory-bank/instructions/` as part of all Memory Bank updates

### Learnings and Insights

- Template-only Memory Bank is insufficient for real project work
- Autonomous agents require up-to-date, project-specific context
- Documentation synchronization is foundational for future development
- Internal documentation and instructions must be discoverable and referenced in all relevant Memory Bank files for agent effectiveness.
