# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Objective:**
Meta Project Maintenance Mode â€” synchronize and populate all Memory Bank core files with real, project-specific information.

**Current Phase:**
Meta-maintenance and documentation synchronization

**Active Sprint/Iteration:**
Memory Bank population and validation (August 2025)

## Recent Changes

### Last Session Summary

- Confirmed all Memory Bank core files are present but only contain template content
- Updated documentation READMEs for prompts, instructions, chatmodes, and scripts to accurately reflect folder contents
- Rebuilt context by reading all Memory Bank core files to rebuild project context at session start

### Recent Decisions

- Begin guided process to populate each Memory Bank file with actual meta project information
- Prioritize `activeContext.md` as the most critical file for current state
- Confirmed understanding of project context and immediate priorities

### Code Changes

- No code changes; documentation and Memory Bank maintenance only
- Updated `activeContext.md` with session start documentation for guided process initiation

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next Session)

1. Populate `projectbrief.md` with meta project identity, vision, and goals
2. Update `productContext.md` with product vision and user experience context
3. Fill in `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md` with real project data

### Upcoming Priorities (Next 2-3 Sessions)

- Complete Memory Bank population for all core files
- Validate cross-references and consistency
- Establish a workflow for ongoing Memory Bank updates

### Pending Dependencies

- Awaiting project-specific details for full population

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions Pending

- None (documentation focus)

### Technical Investigations Required

- None (documentation focus)

### User Experience Considerations

- Ensure documentation is clear, actionable, and supports autonomous AI agent operation

## Context for AI Agents

### Current Mental Model

The project is in a meta-maintenance phase. All Memory Bank files exist but are templates. The immediate goal is to populate them with real, actionable project data to enable effective autonomous operation and cross-agent coordination.

### Critical Patterns to Remember

- Always update Memory Bank after significant changes
- Prioritize `activeContext.md` for current state and next steps
- Maintain cross-file consistency and references

### Learnings and Insights

- Template-only Memory Bank is insufficient for real project work
- Autonomous agents require up-to-date, project-specific context
- Documentation synchronization is foundational for future development
