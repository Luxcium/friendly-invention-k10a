# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

**Primary Objective:**
Meta Project Maintenance Mode â€” synchronize and populate all Memory Bank core files with real, project-specific information.

**Current Phase:**
Meta-maintenance and documentation synchronization

**Active Sprint/Iteration:**
Memory Bank population and validation (August 2025)

### Recent Changes

- Created `devcontainers-expert.chatmode.md` - comprehensive expert chat mode for all dev container scenarios
- Updated `memory-bank/chatmodes/README.md` to include the new chat mode with description
- Synthesized knowledge from all devcontainer documentation files for expert guidance

### Last Session Summary

- Analyzed all devcontainer documentation files to understand comprehensive dev container ecosystem
- Created specialized DevContainers Expert chat mode with deep knowledge of setup, configuration, troubleshooting, and best practices
- Followed Memory Bank protocol and chatmode creation guidelines strictly
- Updated chatmodes documentation to maintain synchronization

### Recent Decisions

- Created DevContainers Expert chat mode to provide specialized knowledge for all dev container scenarios
- Synthesized comprehensive knowledge from 9 devcontainer documentation files into actionable expert guidance
- Prioritized comprehensive coverage over simplified approaches for maximum utility
- Followed strict Memory Bank protocols and chatmode creation guidelines

### Code Changes

- Added `memory-bank/chatmodes/devcontainers-expert.chatmode.md` - comprehensive expert chat mode
- Updated `memory-bank/chatmodes/README.md` to include the new chat mode
- Previously: Added `scripts/build-ts-project.sh`, `Build TypeScript Project` task, and `build-ts-project.prompt.md`
- Previously: Updated scripts/README.md and prompts/README.md

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next Session)

1. Populate `projectbrief.md` with meta project identity, vision, and goals
2. Update `productContext.md` with product vision and user experience context
3. Fill in `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md` with real project data

### Upcoming Priorities (Next 2-3 Sessions)

- Complete Memory Bank population for all core files
- Validate cross-references and consistency
- Establish a workflow for ongoing Memory Bank updates

### Pending Dependencies

- Awaiting project-specific details for full population

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions Pending

- None (documentation focus)

### Technical Investigations Required

- None (documentation focus)

### User Experience Considerations

- Ensure documentation is clear, actionable, and supports autonomous AI agent operation

## Context for AI Agents

### Current Mental Model

The project is in a meta-maintenance phase. All Memory Bank files exist but are templates. The immediate goal is to populate them with real, actionable project data to enable effective autonomous operation and cross-agent coordination.

### Critical Patterns to Remember

- Always update Memory Bank after significant changes
- Prioritize `activeContext.md` for current state and next steps
- Maintain cross-file consistency and references

### Learnings and Insights

- Template-only Memory Bank is insufficient for real project work
- Autonomous agents require up-to-date, project-specific context
- Documentation synchronization is foundational for future development
