./scripts/memory-bank-validate.sh

# Fix any missing files automatically
./scripts/memory-bank-validate.sh --fix
```

## üìã Next Steps for Your Project

### 1. **Define Your Project** (Required)
Edit these files to specify your actual project:
- `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` - Define your project scope and requirements
- `memory-bank/techContext.md` - Specify your technology stack
- `memory-bank/productContext.md` - Define user experience goals

### 2. **Customize AI Agent Instructions** (Optional)
Modify these based on your preferences:
- `memory-bank/instructions/cline.instructions.md` - Adjust Cline workflow
- `memory-bank/instructions/copilot.instructions.md` - Configure Copilot patterns
- `memory-bank/instructions/codex.instructions.md` - Set CLI automation preferences

### 3. **Start Development** (Ready)
- Use `memory-bank/prompts/development.prompt.md` for feature development
- Cline will automatically read memory bank at session start
- Other AI agents will follow documented patterns and standards

## üéâ What Makes This Special

### Revolutionary Memory Bank System
This isn't just documentation - it's an **active intelligence system** that:
- Eliminates context loss between AI sessions
- Ensures consistent AI behavior across tools
- Captures and preserves project knowledge automatically
- Enables true multi-AI coordination

### Production-Ready From Day One
